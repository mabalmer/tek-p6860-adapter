# tek-p6860-adapter

This board is designed to take the Tektronix P6860 compression probe found on many Tektronix logic analyzers and break them out into 0.1" header. It includes a single 9-position SMD DIP switch so that you can individually choose to tie the grounds together to allow single-ended mode usage for the individual inputs. 

The Library folder contains a KiCad symbol and footprint for the probe pad layout.

The base schematic uses J-lead SMD DIP switches to save space, but there is an alternate set of gerber files for gull-wing lead DIP switches in the main directory.
