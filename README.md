# tek-p6860-adapter

This board is designed to take the Tektronix P6860 compression probe found on many Tektronix logic analyzers and break them out into 0.1" header. It includes a single 9-position SMD DIP switch so that you can individually choose to tie the grounds together to allow single-ended mode usage for the individual inputs.
